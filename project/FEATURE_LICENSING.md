## Feature Migration Timeline

### BSL to Apache 2.0 Conversion

Enterprise features convert to Apache 2.0 after 4 years from initial release:

- **v0.4.0-enterprise features** → Apache 2.0 in **2029**
- **v0.5.0-enterprise features** → Apache 2.0 in **2030**
- **v1.0.0-enterprise features** → Apache 2.0 in **2031**

This ensures:
- Long-term open-source availability
- Fair commercial protection period
- Community benefit over time
